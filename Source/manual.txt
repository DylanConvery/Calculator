Defining a variable -
Start by writing "var" at the beginning 
of your statement, followed by a space,
then the name of your variable, followed
by another space and then an '='
followed by another space. Now you
assign your variable a value.

Example : var x = 5 * sqrt(6)

Defining a constant - 
Defining a constant follows the same
steps as for defining a variable except
instead of writing \"var\" at the beginning,
we instead write \"const\" followed by the
a "var" meaning it's a constant variable.

Example : const var x = 5 * sqrt(6)

Predefined constants -
1) pi = 3.141592653
2) e = 2.7182818284
3) k = 1000

Taking input from a file -

Type \"from\" followed by the file name
you are requesting to be interpretted.
